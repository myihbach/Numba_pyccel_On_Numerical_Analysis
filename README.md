# Numba_pyccel_On_Numerical_Analysis

This repository is focusing on two main aspects:

  * Using The finite difference to approximate the solution of some Differential equations well known 
  * How a code written in python may have a high performance 
  compared to fortran or c using some libraries that accelerate code (Numba and pyccel)
